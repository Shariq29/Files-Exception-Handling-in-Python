        "\n",
        "- Memory is allocated in heap memory, not stack memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 2. Reference Counting\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python keeps track of the number of references to each object.\n",
        "\n",
        "- When the reference count drops to zero, the memory can be reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "    a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "    b = a  # Reference count is now 2\n",

        "    del b  # Reference count is now 0 ‚Üí object deleted\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 3. Garbage Collection (GC)\n",
        "\n",
        "- Python has a built-in garbage collector to automatically remove unreachable objects, including those in reference cycles (e.g., object A references B and B references A).\n",
        "\n",
        "- GC handles circular references that reference counting alone can‚Äôt clean up.\n",

        "- Python (specifically CPython) uses an internal mechanism called pymalloc, which manages small object memory using pools and arenas to reduce fragmentation and improve performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### 6. Dynamic Typing\n",
        "\n",
        "Python variables are dynamically typed, which means the memory size can change depending on the value stored:\n",
        "\n",
